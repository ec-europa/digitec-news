title: "Towards an Inter-institutional Register of Delegated Acts: a real life example of close collaboration between institutions"
introduction: The project aimed at creating an Interinstitutional Register of Delegated Acts is a real life example of close cooperation between institutions, with Commission, Parliament, and Council working together to improve the preparation and adoption of delegated acts. The platform will increase transparency for all stakeholders.

#### What is a Delegated Act?

LetÂ´s explain it with an example. In 2011, the European Union (EU) regulated and approved a legislative act that forbade the use of cadmium in new technology sold within the EU. Hence, companies, to sell screens in the EU, had to comply with the new regulation, but as their technology was not ready for such a sudden change, an exemption period was necessary. Therefore, the European Commission has been empowered by the EU co-legislators (the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union) to identify a new deadline for the exemption date. This was done through a delegated act, which is a legally binding decision that regulates important aspects for the general public (ex. customs code). In short, delegated acts are instruments used by the Commission to guarantee the application of EU law.

#### Why there is a need for an Inter-Institutional Register of Delegated Acts?

Manufactures and stakeholders have to comply with delegated acts; thus they have interest to follow the EU decision making process. They have already access to information but it is scattered and therefore difficult to find. In addition, the process is inter-institutional, so there are several information systems involved from the three institutions. All three institutions take decisions for the legislation in question, which make the legislative process complicated.

#### How did the project come into being?

This project aimed at creating an [Inter-institutional Register of Delegated Acts](https://webgate.acceptance.ec.testa.eu/regdel/#/home), which has been planned following the inter-institutional agreement on better law-making signed by the three major European Institutions (the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union). Both events pointed at increasing transparency and efficiency in the preparation, adoption and scrutiny of delegated acts.

The system had to comply with specific characteristics. It had to be well-structured, user friendly, able to enhance transparency, ease planning and enable traceability. The project had initial major challenges to face: work with very short deadlines and with three Institutions and there was a lack of previous similar experiences with stakeholders in inter-institutional projects. Nevertheless, challenges were overcome by leveraging on the project opportunities: there has been a strong mandate and political commitment, spirit of collaboration amongst all stakeholders and a pragmatic approach from business and IT sides.

The project was launched, and it was the result of a legal agreement of the three institutions. It should be fully in place by December 2017.

Planning required collaboration, good will and political support. The main steps followed to set-up the project were:

1.  Define the rules (governance, business owners and system providers), by inspiring in the current PM2 methodology but making it "inter-institutional"

2.  Set up a project team to run the project

3.  Identify the business process, the gaps and what was the available information

4.  Apply a pragmatic view; identify basic features for first release (a minimum viable product)

5.  Develop the system iteratively following an agile approach.

The first step was to put governance in place. The steering committee consisted of representatives from the three institutions. Each representative looked at the needs of each institution. Then, the group identified the process and the architecture. Time was short, and a pragmatic view was maintained. A single responsibility principle guided the system towards a single task. As seen, information was already available but it was scattered on many websites, therefore it was missing an aggregation layer. The RegDel system then became the aggregator, with no need for data/documents input. The system acted as a pointer to the different information sources. Next step was the distribution of information by a channel based on subscription.

Approaching an integration project had some challenges. However, there was no major change made in the source systems, as the project relied mainly on public data, and teams worked in parallel in order to meet deadline based on the definition of well-structured APIs. Overall, an agile project approach was applied; interaction between parties was constant to face issues immediately when they emerged. There was a careful attention in the user experience design, to make it user friendly.
