The IT departments of the European Commission (DIGIT) and the European Parliament (ITEC) have joined forces to organise **DIGITEC 2018: Innovation Space**. The forum brought together the IT communities of the European institutions to share best practices to transform public administration through IT and to discuss how the digital future will shape the way of working in large organisations.
