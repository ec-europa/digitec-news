title: 'Towards an Inter-institutional Register of Delegated Acts: a real life example of close collaboration between institutions'

This project aimed at creating an Inter-institutional Register of Delegated Acts, that took into consideration the needs of the three institutions (Commission, European Parliament, Council) increasing transparency, preparation, adoption of delegated acts.

What is a Delegated Act? In 2011, the EU regulated and approved a legislative act that forbade the use of cadmium in new technology sold within the European Union (EU). Hence, companies, to sell screen in the EU, had to comply with the EU regulation, but their technology was not ready for a sudden change, an exemption period was necessary. Therefore, the European Commission has been empowered by the EU legislator (generally the EU Parliament and the EU Council) to identify a new deadline for the exemption date. This was done through a delegated act, which is a legally binding decision that is very important for the general public (ex. customs code). Delegated acts are instruments used by the European Commission to guarantee the application of EU law.

Why do we need an Inter-Institutional Register of Delegated Acts? Manufactures and stakeholders have to comply with delegated acts; thus they have interest to follow the EU decision making procedure. They have access to information - and it is also widely available - but it is difficult to find what and where. There are several information systems involved, as the delegated acts comprise the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council. All three institutions take decisions for the legislation in question, which make the legislative process complicated. For the purpose of improving the law-making procedure between European Institutions, it has been decided to start a new project with the scope to provide information about the delegated acts.
